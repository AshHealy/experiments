help me write a shop system for a game that uses json to store the information about available items for the game

The shop system should have the ability to store game information in a JSON format. This information should include the item name, description, price, and any other relevant information. The system should also have the ability to handle multiple currencies, such as gold coins, gems, or other in-game currency. 

The shop system should have an easy to use interface that allows players to quickly find and purchase the items they are looking for. This system should also be able to track player purchases and display statistics on what items are being purchased and how much they are spending.

The shop system should also have a secure payment system that allows players to safely purchase items with real-world money. This system should also have the ability to store player information such as credit card numbers and other sensitive data in a secure manner.

Finally, the shop system should offer the ability to create and edit items from within the game. This should allow developers to easily add, remove, or modify items in the shop without needing to manually update the JSON files. This will help keep the shop system up to date and make it easier for players to purchase the items they are looking for.
